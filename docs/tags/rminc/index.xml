      <description>Intro In this post I will demonstrate how to use my package ABIgeneRMINC to download, read and analyze mouse brain gene expression data from the Allen Brain Institute.
The Allen Brain Institute (ABI) has acquired and released genome-wide spatial gene expression maps for the mouse brain. The data is generated using in situ hybridization experiments (ISH), where nucleotide probes for specific genes bind directly to mouse brain tissue. The probe binding is then marked with a biotin label that can be used to locate regions where a gene is expressed.</description>

      <description>So, peaks. When producing a statistical map, it’s good to get a report of the peaks (i.e. most significant findings). RMINC has had this support for a while now, though it has remained somewhat hidden. Here’s a bit of an intro, then.
I will walk through the example we used from the Mouse Imaging Summer School in 2017, which is data from this paper:
de Guzman AE, Gazdzinski LM, Alsop RJ, Stewart JM, Jaffray DA, Wong CS, Nieman BJ.</description>
