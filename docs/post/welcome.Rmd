Hello World!

Welcome to the new Mouse Imaging Centre Blog.

We created this blog as a place to share things we've been
thinking about lately. This blog will feature a mixture of
technical writing about things we do in our lab including
imaging, statistics, and biology. The blog will feature
contributions from our staff, students, and PIs. 

We hope you enjoy our writings.

To learn more about us please visit our website at
http://www.mouseimaging.ca/ or check us out on
github https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre.
