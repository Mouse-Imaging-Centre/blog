<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>Welcome to the new Mouse Imaging Centre Blog.</p>
<p>We created this blog as a place to share things weâ€™ve been thinking about lately. This blog will feature a mixture of technical writing about things we do in our lab including imaging, statistics, and biology. The blog will feature contributions from our staff, students, and PIs.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our writings.</p>
<p>To learn more about us please visit our website at <a href="http://www.mouseimaging.ca/" class="uri">http://www.mouseimaging.ca/</a> or check us out on github <a href="https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre" class="uri">https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre</a>.</p>
