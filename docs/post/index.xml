      <description>Hi readers,
Recently I got back from StanCon 2018 Ansilomar. I had a little time waiting for one of my flights and I thought I’d reflect on the conference. Last year I was lucky enough to go to the first StanCon and it was nice to be able to see how the conference has grown. This year it was three days of tutorials, talks, and networking. I had a blast.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
Welcome to the new Mouse Imaging Centre Blog.
We created this blog as a place to share things we’ve been thinking about lately. This blog will feature a mixture of technical writing about things we do in our lab including imaging, statistics, and biology. The blog will feature contributions from our staff, students, and PIs.
We hope you enjoy our writings.
